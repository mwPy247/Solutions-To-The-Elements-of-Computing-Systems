# Solutions-To-The-Elements-of-Computing-Systems
My Solutions to the Exercises in the book "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Shocken.
## What has been finished so far
I finished the implementation of almost all the chips from the first three chapters. Beginning with basic logic gates in the first chapter, the second chapter introduces a basic ALU, culminating in a complete Von Neumann PC in the third chapter. All chips are implemented in HDL.
### Detailed List
##### Chapter 1:
- Not Gate
- And Gate (simple and 16-bit)
- Or Gate (simple and 16-bit)
- Xor Gate
- 8 Way Or Gate
- 16-bit Multiplexer (simple, 4-Way and 8-Way)
- Demultiplexer (simple, 4-Way and 8-Way)
##### Chapter 2:
- Half Adder
- Full Adder
- 16-bit Incrementer
- 16-bit Adder
- ALU
##### Chapter 3:
- 1-bit Register
- 16-bit Register
- 8-Register RAM
- 64-Register RAM
- 512-Register RAM
- 4k-Register RAM
- 16-Register RAM

To be continued...
